" REVISION	DATE		REMARKS
"   1.40.023	18-Apr-2013	Use optional visualrepeat#reapply#VisualMode()
"				for normal mode repeat of a visual mapping.
"				When supplying a [count] on such repeat of a
"				previous linewise selection, now [count] number
"				of lines instead of [count] times the original
"				selection is used.
"   1.31.021	28-Nov-2012	BUG: When repeat.vim is not installed, the grr
"				and v_gr mappings do nothing. Need to :execute
"				the :silent! call of repeat.vim to avoid that
"				the remainder of the command line is aborted
"				together with the call.
"   1.31.020	11-Sep-2012	Minor: Use current line for no-op modification
"				check.
"   1.30.019	21-Oct-2011	Employ repeat.vim to have the expression
"				re-evaluated on repetition of the
"				operator-pending mapping.
"				Pull <SID>Reselect into the main mapping (the
"				final <Esc> is important to "seal" the visual
"				selection and make it recallable via gv),
"				because it doesn't multiply the selection size
"				when [count] is given.
"   1.30.018	21-Oct-2011	BUG: <SID>Reselect swallows register repeat set
"				by repeat.vim. Don't re-use
"				<SID>ReplaceWithRegisterVisual and get rid of
"				it, and instead insert <SID>Reselect in the
"				middle of the expanded
"				<Plug>ReplaceWithRegisterVisual, after the
"				register handling, before the eventual function
"				invocation.
"   1.30.017	30-Sep-2011	Add register registration to enhanced repeat.vim
"				plugin, which also handles repetition when used
"				together with the expression register "=.
"				Undo parallel <Plug>ReplaceWithRegisterRepeat...
"				mappings, as this is now handled by the enhanced
"				repeat.vim plugin.
"				No need for <silent> in default mappings.
"   1.30.015	24-Sep-2011	ENH: Handling use of expression register "=.
"				BUG: v:register is not replaced during command
"				repetition, so repeat always used the unnamed
"				register. Added parallel
"				<Plug>ReplaceWithRegisterRepeat... mappings that
"				omit the <SID>SetRegister() and <SID>IsExprReg()
"				stuff and are registered for repetition instead
"				of the original mappings.
"				Moved functions from plugin to separate autoload
"				script. No need to pass <SID>-opfunc to
"				ReplaceWithRegister#OperatorExpression().
"   1.20.014	26-Apr-2011	BUG: ReplaceWithRegisterOperator didn't work
"				correctly with linewise motions (like "+"); need
"				to use a linewise visual selection in this case.
"   1.20.013	23-Apr-2011	BUG: Text duplicated from yanked previous lines
"				is inserted on a replacement of a visual
"				blockwise selection. Need a special case, which
"				actually is tricky because of the detection of
"				the end-of-the-line in combination with having
"				two cursor positions (via v_o) in a blockwise
"				selection. Instead of following down that road,
"				switch to a put in visual mode in combination
"				with a save and restore of the unnamed register.
"				This should handle all cases and doesn't require
"				the autoindent workaround, neither.
"   1.10.012	18-Mar-2011	The operator-pending mapping now also handles
"				'nomodifiable' and 'readonly' buffers without
"				function errors. Add checking and probing inside
"				s:ReplaceWithRegisterOperatorExpression().
"   1.10.011	17-Mar-2011	Add experimental support for repeating the
"				replacement also in visual mode through
"				visualrepeat.vim. Renamed vmap
"				<Plug>ReplaceWithRegisterOperator to
"				<Plug>ReplaceWithRegisterVisual for that.
"				A repeat in visual mode will now apply the
"				previous line and operator replacement to the
"				selection text. A repeat in normal mode will
"				apply the previous visual mode replacement at
"				the current cursor position, using the size of
"				the last visual selection.
"   1.03.010	07-Jan-2011	ENH: Better handling when buffer is
"				'nomodifiable' or 'readonly'. Using the trick of
"				prepending a no-op buffer modification before
"				invoking the functions. Using try...catch inside
"				s:ReplaceWithRegister() would break the needed
"				abort inside the :normal sequence of replacing
"				the selection, then inserting the register. The
"				disastrous result would be erroneous
"				interpretation of <C-O> as a normal mode
"				command!
"   1.02.009	25-Nov-2009	Replaced the <SID>Count workaround with
"				:map-expr and an intermediate
"				s:ReplaceWithRegisterOperatorExpression.
"   1.01.008	06-Oct-2009	Do not define "gr" mapping for select mode;
"				printable characters should start insert mode.
"   1.00.007	05-Jul-2009	Renamed from ingooperators.vim.
"				Replaced g:register with call to
"				s:SetRegister().
"	006	05-Mar-2009	BF: Besides 'autoindent', 'indentexpr' also
"				causes additional indent. Now completely turning
"				off all these things via the 'paste' option.
"	005	23-Feb-2009	BF: When replacing a complete line over an
"				indented line (with 'Vgr' or 'grr'), the old
"				indent was kept. Now temporarily turning off
"				'autoindent' to avoid that.
"	004	20-Feb-2009	BF: ReplaceWithRegisterOperator mapping didn't
"				work for "last line" G motion, because v:count1
"				defaulted to line 1. Now checking v:count and
"				mapping to <Nop> if no count was given.
"	003	01-Feb-2009	Allowing repeating via '.' by avoiding the
"				script error about undefined variable
"				g:register.
"				Put try...finally around temporary 'selection'
"				setting.
"				ENH: Now allowing [count] in front of
"				gr{motion} (see :help ingo-opfunc for details)
"				and grr (via repeat.vim).
"				Now correcting mismatch when replacement is
"				linewise by temporarily removing the trailing
"				newline.
"	002	15-Aug-2008	Added {Visual}gr and grr mappings.
"	001	11-Aug-2008	file creation

" Avoid installing twice or when in unsupported Vim version.
