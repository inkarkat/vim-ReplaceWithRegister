" ReplaceWithRegister.vim: Replace text with the contents of a register. 
"
" DESCRIPTION:
"   Replacing an existing text with the contents of a register is a very common
"   task during editing. One typically first deletes the existing text via the
"   |d|, |D| or |dd| commands, then pastes the register with |p| or |P|. 
"   Most of the time, the unnamed register is involved, with the following
"   pitfall: If you forget to delete into the black-hole register ("_), the
"   replacement text is overwritten! 
"
"   This plugin offers a two-in-one command that replaces text covered by a
"   {motion}, entire line(s) or the current selection with the contents of a
"   register; the old text is deleted into the black-hole register. 
"
"   The replacement mode (characters or entire lines) is determined by the
"   replacement command / selection, not by the register contents. This avoids
"   surprises like when the replacement text was a linewise yank, but the
"   replacement is characterwise: In this case, no additional newline is
"   inserted. 
"
" USAGE:
"["x][count]gr{motion}	Replace {motion} text with the contents of register x. 
"			Especially when using the unnamed register, this is
"			quicker than "_d{motion}P or "_c{motion}<C-R>"
"["x][count]grr		Replace [count] lines with the contents of register x. 
"			To replace from the cursor position to the end of the
"			line use ["x]gr$ 
"{Visual}["x]gr		Replace the selection with the contents of register x. 
"
" INSTALLATION:
"   Put the script into your user or system Vim plugin directory (e.g.
"   ~/.vim/plugin). 

" DEPENDENCIES:
"   - Requires Vim 7.0 or higher. 
"   - repeat.vim (vimscript #2136) autoload script (optional). 
"
" CONFIGURATION:
"   The default mappings override the (rarely used, but somewhat related) |gr|
"   command (replace virtual characters under the cursor with {char}). 
"   If you want to use different mappings, map your keys to the
"   <Plug>ReplaceWithRegister... mapping targets _before_ sourcing this script
"   (e.g. in your |vimrc|): 
"	nmap <silent> <Leader>r <Plug>ReplaceWithRegisterOperator
"    	nmap <silent> <Leader>rr <Plug>ReplaceWithRegisterLine
"    	vmap <silent> <Leader>r <Plug>ReplaceWithRegisterOperator

" REVISION	DATE		REMARKS 
"   1.01.008	06-Oct-2009	Do not define "gr" mapping for select mode;
"				printable characters should start insert mode. 
"   1.00.007	05-Jul-2009	Renamed from ingooperators.vim. 
"				Replaced g:register with call to
"				s:SetRegister(). 
"	006	05-Mar-2009	BF: Besides 'autoindent', 'indentexpr' also
"				causes additional indent. Now completely turning
"				off all these things via the 'paste' option. 
"	005	23-Feb-2009	BF: When replacing a complete line over an
"				indented line (with 'Vgr' or 'grr'), the old
"				indent was kept. Now temporarily turning off
"				'autoindent' to avoid that. 
"	004	20-Feb-2009	BF: ReplaceWithRegisterOperator mapping didn't
"				work for "last line" G motion, because v:count1
"				defaulted to line 1. Now checking v:count and
"				mapping to <Nop> if no count was given. 
"	003	01-Feb-2009	Allowing repeating via '.' by avoiding the
"				script error about undefined variable
"				g:register. 
"				Put try...finally around temporary 'selection'
"				setting. 
"				ENH: Now allowing [count] in front of
"				gr{motion} (see :help ingo-opfunc for details)
"				and grr (via repeat.vim). 
"				Now correcting mismatch when replacement is
"				linewise by temporarily removing the trailing
"				newline. 
"	002	15-Aug-2008	Added {Visual}gr and grr mappings. 
"	001	11-Aug-2008	file creation

" Avoid installing twice or when in unsupported Vim version.
